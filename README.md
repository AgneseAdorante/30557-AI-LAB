# AI-LAB

This repository contains code for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and supervised learning models for the HCC1806 DROP-seq dataset, realized for the AI LAB class. The code provides insights into the dataset, performs feature selection, and evaluates several machine learning models for classification.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA code provides insights into the dataset and performs various analyses:

- Dataset Structure
- Empty and Duplicate Elements
- Distribution Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Target Variables
- Visualization of the Data
  
## Supervised Learning Models
The code implements and evaluates several supervised learning models for classification:

- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network
  
## Models Comparison and Evaluation
The code compares the performance of the different models and evaluates them based on accuracy scores, cross-entropy loss, and mean squared error loss. It visualizes the results using bar plots.
